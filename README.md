# drg_model
A very simple ARIMA model for the online game Deep Rock Galacitc coded using R.

Just download the .csv-file and the model.R-file.

Place them in the same folder ("root").

Adapt setwd() in model.R to your working environment.

Run the code.

Fingers crossed there should be a png-file with the DRG ARIMA model in the root folder.
